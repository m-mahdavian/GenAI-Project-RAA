Description for the final Python script (reviewer_agent_script.py)
Reviewer Assistant Agent (RAA)
Overview:
This Python script implements a "Reviewer Assistant Agent" (RAA) designed to automate key parts of the scientific manuscript peer-review process. Utilizing the LangChain framework and an OpenAI language model (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini), the agent analyzes a submitted manuscript (in PDF format), extracts specific quantitative findings, searches for similar articles online, extracts comparable data from those articles, and presents a structured comparison. The entire workflow is orchestrated by a LangChain AgentExecutor managing a suite of custom tools.
Goal:
The primary goal is to assist scientific reviewers by:
1.	Providing a concise summary of a manuscript's core findings.
2.	Automatically extracting predefined quantitative metrics (Corrosion Inhibition Efficiency %, Impedance ohm.cm², Adhesion Strength MPa) from the manuscript.
3.	Identifying potentially relevant existing literature via web search based on the manuscript's title.
4.	Attempting to extract the same quantitative metrics from found online articles (PDFs or HTML) for quick comparison against the submitted manuscript's results.
Workflow & Functionality:
The script executes the following steps, orchestrated by the LangChain agent:
1.	Initialization: Parses command-line arguments (PDF path, API key, configurations) and initializes the specified OpenAI LLM.
2.	Load Manuscript: Uses a custom LoadManuscriptTool (wrapping PyPDFLoader) to load the text content and page data from the input PDF file.
3.	Identify Title: Infers the manuscript title primarily from the loaded text, using the filename as a fallback.
4.	Summarize Manuscript: Employs a SummarizeManuscriptTool (using load_summarize_chain) to generate a brief summary of the manuscript based on the loaded page data.
5.	Extract Manuscript Metrics: Calls an ExtractMetricsTool to query the LLM, analyzing the full manuscript text to extract specific quantitative values for Corrosion Inhibition (%), Impedance (ohm.cm²), and Adhesion (MPa), guided by a detailed prompt.
6.	Search Similar Articles: If a title was identified, uses a SearchSimilarArticlesTool (wrapping the duckduckgo-search library) to find URLs of potentially similar articles online. The number of results requested is configurable.
7.	Process Similar Articles: Iterates through a configurable number of the found URLs. For each URL, a ProcessWebArticleTool attempts to:
o	Download a PDF directly.
o	If the URL is HTML, parse it to find PDF links and attempt download.
o	If no PDF is downloadable, attempt to extract text directly from the HTML content.
o	If text is successfully extracted (from PDF or HTML), it calls the same ExtractMetricsTool used in step 5 to find the corrosion, impedance, and adhesion metrics within that article's text.
o	Records the processing status (e.g., PDF downloaded, HTML parsed, extraction successful/failed) and the extracted data for each processed URL.
8.	Compile & Output Results: The agent gathers all collected information (manuscript title, summary, manuscript data, list of processed similar articles with their status and data) and formats it into a single JSON object as the final output.
9.	Display & Save: The main script block parses this JSON output, prints the manuscript analysis and similar articles data in a user-friendly format (including a Pandas DataFrame table for similar articles), and optionally saves the similar articles data to a CSV file in the specified output directory.
Core Technologies:
•	Orchestration: LangChain AgentExecutor with create_openai_functions_agent.
•	LLM: OpenAI ChatOpenAI (model configurable, e.g., gpt-4.1-mini).
•	Custom Tools: LangChain BaseTool subclasses for specific tasks (loading, summarizing, extracting, searching, processing URLs).
•	Tool Schemas: Pydantic V1 (BaseModel, Field) for defining tool input arguments.
•	Web Search: duckduckgo-search library.
•	PDF Handling: PyPDFLoader (from langchain_community).
•	Web Interaction: requests library for downloading, BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing.
•	Text Processing: LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, load_summarize_chain.
•	Data Handling: pandas for displaying results.
•	Execution: Standard Python 3, argparse for command-line arguments, logging.
Inputs:
•	Required:
o	Path to the input manuscript PDF file (via command-line argument).
o	OpenAI API Key (via --api-key argument, OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, or Kaggle Secrets).
•	Optional (Command-line Arguments):
o	Output directory (--output-dir).
o	LLM model name (--model).
o	Max search results (--max-search).
o	Max similar articles to fully process (--max-process).
o	Download timeout (--timeout).
o	Max characters for LLM extraction (--max-extract-chars).
o	Quiet mode (--quiet).
Outputs:
1.	Console Output: Logs agent actions (if verbose), processing status, and final formatted results.
2.	Primary Result (Printed JSON): A JSON object containing:
o	manuscript_analysis: includes title, summary, and extracted_data (dict with metrics).
o	similar_articles_analysis: A list of dictionaries, each representing a processed URL with its url, status, and extracted metrics (corrosion_inhibition_%, impedance_ohm_cm2, adhesion_MPa).
3.	CSV File (Optional): A similar_articles_data.csv file saved in the output directory containing the data from similar_articles_analysis.
This script provides a powerful, automated starting point for reviewers looking to quickly understand a manuscript's key contributions and compare them against relevant online literature.
